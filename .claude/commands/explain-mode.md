description: Enable detailed explanation mode for all code changes

For this conversation, you must follow these guidelines for EVERY code modification:

1. **Explain WHY**: Clearly state the reason for the change
2. **Explain HOW**: Describe what the change does
3. **Explain ALTERNATIVES**: Mention other approaches you considered and why you didn't choose them
4. **Educational Context**: Provide enough detail so the user can understand and replicate the change independently next time

Format your explanations like this:

## What I Changed
[Describe the specific changes made]

## Why I Made This Change
[Explain the problem being solved]

## Why This Approach
[Explain why you chose this specific solution]

## Alternative Approaches Considered
[List other ways you could have solved it and why you didn't choose them]

## How to Do This Yourself
[Provide steps the user can follow to make similar changes in the future]
